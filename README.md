# Vector Embedding

Vector embedding is a technique used to convert data items—whether they are words, sentences, entire documents, or even images—into a vector of real numbers which represent the items in a continuous vector space. This process is foundational in machine learning, especially in natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition, because it enables algorithms to perform mathematical operations on complex data types. Here's a detailed breakdown of the concept:

### Basic Idea

- **Representation**: Each item (like a word or image) is represented as a dense vector of fixed size, where each dimension of the vector captures some aspect of the item's meaning or features.
- **Dimensionality**: Typically, these vectors are of a much lower dimensionality compared to the original data space. For example, a vocabulary of 10,000 unique words might be represented in a 300-dimensional vector space.
- **Continuous Space**: The embedding places similar items close together in the vector space. This means that items (e.g., words) with similar meanings or usage in language are located near each other, forming a meaningful geometric space.

### Techniques and Applications

1. **Word Embeddings**: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText generate vectors for words based on their co-occurrence information in large text corpora. These embeddings capture semantic relationships, such as synonyms, antonyms, and more complex linguistic patterns.

2. **Sentence and Document Embeddings**: Extensions of word embedding techniques, like Doc2Vec or sentence transformers, generate embeddings for longer pieces of text. These embeddings capture the overall meaning and can be used for document classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

3. **Graph Embeddings**: In the context of graph data (e.g., social networks, knowledge graphs), embedding techniques project nodes and possibly edges into vector spaces, preserving information like node adjacency or graph topology.

4. **Image Embeddings**: Techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can generate embeddings for images, capturing visual features at various levels of abstraction. These embeddings enable tasks such as image classification, object detection, and more.

### Properties

- **Similarity Measures**: In the embedded space, similarity between items can be measured using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or other distance metrics. This is crucial for tasks like nearest neighbor searches, clustering, and anomaly detection.

- **Transferability**: Embeddings learned from one task or dataset can often be transferred and used in other tasks or datasets, leveraging the generalizability of learned representations. This is a cornerstone of transfer learning.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Besides capturing semantic or feature similarities, embeddings also serve as a form of dimensionality reduction, making it easier to process and analyze data.

# Vector Search
Vector search on the other hand is used to find and retrieve the informations that are most similar or relevant to the given query. Vector search will try to understand the meaning or context of the given query, for example, querying a "car" may retrive or return the information related to "driver", "tyre" or "hybrid".
